  abstract = {Warmer and drier climate over the past few decades has brought larger fire sizes and increased annual area burned in forested ecosystems of western North America, and continued increases in annual area burned are expected due to climate change. As warming continues, fires may also increase in severity and produce larger contiguous patches of severely burned areas. We used remotely sensed burn-severity data from 125 fires in the northern Cascade Range of Washington, USA, to explore relationships between fire size, severity, and the spatial pattern of severity. We examined relationships between climate and the annual area burned and the size of wildfires over a 25-year period. We tested the hypothesis that increased fire size is commensurate with increased burn severity and increased spatial aggregation of severely burned areas. We also asked how local ecological controls might modulate these relationships by comparing results over the whole study area (the northern Cascade Range) to those from four ecological subsections within it. We found significant positive relationships between climate and fire size, and between fire size and the proportion of high severity and spatial-pattern metrics that quantify the spatial aggregation of high-severity areas within fires, but the strength and significance of these relationships varied among the four subsections. In areas with more contiguous subalpine forests and less complex topography, the proportion and spatial aggregation of severely burned areas were more strongly correlated with fire size. If fire sizes increase in a warming climate, changes in the extent, severity, and spatial pattern of fire regimes are likely to be more pronounced in higher-severity fire regimes with less complex topography and more continuous fuels.},

  abstract = {Methods We applied structural equation modeling to satellite burn-severity maps of fires in the US Northern Rocky Mountains (1984\textendash{}2010) to test for direct and indirect (via influence on fire size and proportion stand-replacing) effects of climate/weather, vegetation, and topography on landscape patterns of standreplacing fire. We also tested for temporal trends in landscape patterns.
Results Landscape patterns of stand-replacing fire were strongly controlled by fire size and proportion stand-replacing, which were, in turn, controlled by climate/weather and vegetation/topography, respectively. From 1984 to 2010, the proportion of standreplacing fire within burn perimeters increased from 0.22 to 0.27. Trends for other landscape metrics were not significant, but may respond to further increases proportion stand-replacing fire.
Conclusions Fires from 1984 to 2010 exhibited tremendous heterogeneity in landscape patterns of stand-replacing fire, likely promoting resilience in burned areas. If trends continue on the current trajectory, however, fires may produce larger and simpler shaped patches of stand-replacing fire with more burned area far from seed sources.},

  title = {{{USING SIZE}}\textendash{{FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS TO ANALYZE FIRE REGIMES IN FLORIDA}}},
  abstract = {Wildfire regimes in natural forest ecosystems have been characterized with power\textendash{}law distributions. In this paper, we evaluated whether wildfire regimes in a human-dominated landscape were also consistent with power\textendash{}law distributions. Our case study focused on wildfires in Florida, a state with rapid population growth and consequent rapid alteration of forest ecosystems and natural fire regimes. We found that all fire size\textendash{}frequency distributions evaluated in this study were consistent with power\textendash{}law distributions, but the power\textendash{}law distributions were piece-wise linear. A kink in the power\textendash{}law distributions occurred at about 640 ha for flatwoods fires and at about 290 ha for swamp fires. Above these levels, fires ``exploded'' into a catastrophic regime. If the kink represents the level at which fires become immune to fire suppression effort, we would expect that the location of the kink would occur at smaller fire sizes during extreme fire years due to the increased flammability of fuels and the relative scarcity of fire suppression resources. We found this result for three of four extreme fire years in flatwoods ecosystems and for all four extreme fire years in swamps. These results suggest that catastrophic fires may not be possible to prevent and that suppression efforts during extreme fire years may be best applied to strategic areas that decrease the connectivity of fuels.},

  abstract = {The perception is that today's large fires are an ecological catastrophe because they burn vast areas with high intensities and severities. However, little is known of the ecological impacts of large fires on both historical and contemporary landscapes. The present paper presents a review of the current knowledge of the effects of large fires in the United States by important ecosystems written by regional experts. The ecosystems are (1) ponderosa pine\textendash{}Douglas-fir, (2) sagebrush\textendash{}grasslands, (3) pi\~non\textendash{}juniper, (4) chaparral, (5) mixed-conifer, and (6) spruce\textendash{}fir. This review found that large fires were common on most historical western US landscapes and they will continue to be common today with exceptions. Sagebrush ecosystems are currently experiencing larger, more severe, and more frequent large fires compared to historical conditions due to exotic cheatgrass invasions. Historical large fires in south-west ponderosa pine forest created a mixed severity mosaic dominated by non-lethal surface fires while today's large fires are mostly high severity crown fires. While large fires play an important role in landscape ecology for most regions, their importance is much less in the dry pi\~non\textendash{}juniper forests and sagebrush\textendash{}grasslands. Fire management must address the role of large fires in maintaining the health of many US fire-dominated ecosystems.},
